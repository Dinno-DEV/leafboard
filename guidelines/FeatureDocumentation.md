# Feature Folders
feature_ideas is where you put fresh new ideas, but not approved.

feature_planned is where you take the ideas on the feature and plan it.
feature_planned documents should always have "do's and don't s" section to declare feature scope.

feature_documented is documentation for finished features.
feature_documented documents should always have "do's and don't s" section to declare feature scope.

all feature folders should be sorted to:
res_files, root_scenes, components, gui_components, singletons, 
libraries, custom_node_scripts, custom_resource_scripts.
